Kaizen is a tool to make internet research easier. Do you often find yourself with a thousand tabs? Let's slaughter those tabs and move on. With Kaizen, you can save the one silly quote that you wanted from it by just hotkeying ctrl-1 or ctrl-2 to whatever injective topic you choose. And if you haven't set one yet, do it on the fly with ctrl-`

Me? My getup is to have ctrl-2 bound to everything under the sun and ctrl-1 to the muse of the moment. She's a hot chica too.

More shit coming. Install now and get it while the bacon's frying.
